```
1. Smart Homes
2. Agriculture
3. Manufacturing
4. Retail
5. Electronic
6. Health Care
7. Logistics
```

## WHaat is needed to setup IoT
```
1. Sensor nodes
2. SDK / API
3. Gateway
4. Cloud Connection
5. Web / Apps
```

```
1. Software-Defined


2. Hardware-Defined 
- Sensor (Gather data)
- Actuator (Make physical changes)
- Embeded system

2. Network Fabric Makeup
- Operational Technology (OT) Network
- IT network
- Backhaul
- Internet (Public Cloud) 
- IoT Product cloud (private) - Highly computing extension of IoT product
- IoT platform - MIDDLEWARE

3. External System Interface
- Online data sources
- Accessed through API
- 4 MAIN components (Analytic, Data Services, Business Systems & IoT products
- This differential IoT product -> Smart Product -> Connected Product
```


## Basic Understanding
```
1. Programming
2. Networking
3. Data Analytic
```

## What is IoT
```
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention. 
```

## Business applying IoT
```
1. B2C
- Consumer
2. B2B
- Commercial
- Industrial
- Infrastructure
```

## Architectural Overview
```
# 1. Product Type
1. Smart product
- Just having embedded devices
- Determine Timing
2. Connected product
- Just by connecting dryer to smartphone
3. IoT product
- Can dry clothes as quickly as possible
- Dry them for as low cost as possbile
- Can be connected to a NETWORK of othr IoT dryer

# 2. Engineering view
1. Similar to networking stack architecture
2. From Physical layer -> data link layer THROUGH networking layer to the Application layer
```

## Design view (System Integrator) 
```
1. Front end (User touch points)
2. Enabling infrastructure 
3. Backend (Admin touch points)
```

## Business View (Value perspective)
```
1. Software-defined product
- To virtualize the physical into the digital
2. Hardware-defined product
- tech or IoT product: collect data & info / transform it into useful info
- Hardware-defined product & External system: collect data & transport it through network fabric -> software-defined product (transform it something valuable)
3. Network fabric
4. External system interface
```

## 1. Software-defined product

### 1. Cybermodel
```
represented mathematically using statistics
```

### 2. Application
```
Where is the application executed in the IoT product?
1. in the cloud
2. on the mobile device
3. within the embedded system
```

### 3. Data Analytic


## 2. Hardware-defined product
### 1. Connected Sensor & Actuator
- Compromised of Sensor & Embedded system
